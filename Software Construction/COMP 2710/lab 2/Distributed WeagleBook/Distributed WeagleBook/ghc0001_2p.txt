Testing and explanation of output:
Since everthing is written into files, this program can be used wherever a NFS is in place. As long as the program can read the files, it can perform its duty. 

1) Line 177
2) Through Implementation, I decided that, in order for the user to be able to log back on, they needed to be able to enter the same name again thus rendering this test case unapplicable. 
3) Line 316
4) After reevaluating the assignment, I determined that it was not necessary to have more than one user logged in at the same time, but just necessary for more than one user to be able to access all of the files from different locations. 
5) Line 106
6) This is seen on the back end of the program. You can also look into the "time.txt" file when this program is run to see that it grabs the largest number from that file. 
7)Line 328 


Compilation instructions: 
1) Navigate to location. 
2) Input "make"
3) Input "./a.out"
